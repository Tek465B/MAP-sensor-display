# MAP-sensor-display
This read data from GM 2-bar MAP sensor, display the atmospheric pressure for 3 second and then display boost pressure in PSI and vacuum in In-Hg, refresh rate is 500ms.

The code should be updated to read an input pin configured with a pullup resistor and jumper to enable/disable the calibration routine instead of re-programming the flash after calibration.
